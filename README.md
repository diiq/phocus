# Phocus: react focus and action management, with hotkeys and context-sensitive help

Phocus does silly things to browser focus, and you probably shouldn't use it.

It does let your users set, change, and unset keyboard shortcuts for all manner of actions in your app, and those shortcuts can be context-dependent, based on what object has focus.

## Installing

`yarn add phocus` or `npm install phocus`.

Phocus comes with typescript typings; no need to install them separately.

## Usage

## Example usage
